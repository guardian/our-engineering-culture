# Guidelines for inclusive communication

The purpose of these guidelines are to provide some best practices and examples of inclusive communication. Just like many other best practices, you may be referred to these guidelines by your colleagues as part of code reviews, feedback sessions, document comments, and retrospectives, etc, so please do take time to digest them effectively. They are relevant to all forms of communication including verbal, written, drawing and code.

Please do submit any edits you feel necessary, and these will be reviewed and merged by a member of the EM team.

## Why is inclusive language important?

*   Makes people feel naturally included
*   Doesn’t trigger memories of someones’ prior trauma
*   Brings more individuals within the perceived normality
*   Helps overcome rather than cement peoples’ cognitive biases

## Accountability

It can be difficult to suddenly stop using words that have been in general circulation for many years, and it’s understandable that people will still use them accidentally. How you react to repair your miscommunication is far more important than whether you made it or not.

If you would like to cement the improvements in both your own and your team’s mind, a good way to do it is by spending some time reviewing existing materials and making changes. See the associated resources below.

## Dignity at Work

GNM takes deliberate or repeated use of non-inclusive language very seriously, so if you are aware of this happening, please report it to a manager or HR as normal. GNM’s Dignity at Work policy can be found in the [GNM Employee Handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bCE8b68Or6E7xnS7kqwSk1cL0h7byC56/).
