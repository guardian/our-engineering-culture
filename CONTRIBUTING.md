How to contribute
=================
- Any engineer at the Guardian is welcome - indeed encouraged - to contribute to both the statement of our culture and this contribution guide.

- Keep the word count low, and focus on what's important.

- Wanna change something? Provisional idea of how this could work: raise PR, gather 5 or more +1's and no -1's, merge.
