We believe that our culture is important, and we all contribute to it regardless of our role or level.

>Every one of us has multiple interactions with a variety of people across the department and company every day. Each one of those is an opportunity to express and refine our culture. This written statement of our culture is shared, and anyone can [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md).


We believe that all of us want to - and can - make a difference to the Guardian.

>We choose to work here because we believe in what the Guardian stands for. We're excited at contributing to the Guardian's future. 

We believe in treating everyone we encounter with respect.

>Whether meeting physically or electronically, whether friend or stranger, whether employee, customer or commenter, we respect the opinion of others and are gracious in our interactions.

We are respectful of different skill sets and levels of ability.
>We come from different backgrounds, work in different roles, are different ages, and therefore have different levels of experience. All in all, we pull each other up, not bring each other down.

We believe we are empowered to meet the needs of people we encounter across the Guardian.

>This behaviour is consistently encouraged across all levels of engineering.

We believe that embracing technical innovation and excellence can help us make a difference

> By trying to deeply understand technologies and stay informed of technical innovation we are able to engineer or adopt new tools and solutions that allow us to achieve the Guardian's objectives

We care.

>We are not driven to simply deliver the implementation of a specification, but delight in working collaboratively to achieve an objective. In return, we are enthused to do whatever we can to deliver value to the Guardian.
